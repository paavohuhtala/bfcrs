[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paavohuhtala/bfcrs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paavohuhtala/bfcrs)

This is a WIP Rust port of my optimizing Brainfuck compiler, [bfcfs](https://github.com/paavohuhtala/bfcfs/). At the time of writing this is just a normal non-optimizing interpreter written in less than an hour, but the eventual goal is to include all of the previous optimizations, and to compile to x86-64 machine code and/or WebAssembly.
